* Frequency transposition invariance : see core/scat_freq.m
* Roto-translation invariance : see core/wavelet_factory_3d_pyramid.m
* Inverse scattering transform for 1D : see reconstruction/
* Selesnick wavelets of compact support : see
filters/selesnick_filter_bank_1d.
* Improved display : see display/
* New utility functions for classification : see scatutils/
* A comprehensive documentation PDF file : see doc/

ScatNet v0.2
------------

ScatNet is a MATLAB library for scattering networks.

See our homepage of the project for documentation, tutorials, and bibliography

where [AT] and [DOT] must be replaced by the characters @ and . respectively.

Install ScatNet
---------------

- launch `addpath_scatnet` from matlab shell

[optional] : add the following two lines to your startup.m file
so that matlab does the addpath automatically when it starts: 


    addpath /path/to/scatnet;
    addpath_scatnet;

Quickstarts
